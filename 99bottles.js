// 99 bottles
// Since you know how to use for loops now, 
// try to make a function that counts down from 99 to 0 and signs 99 bottles of beer on the wall.
//
// Fill in the details inside the loop to print the following:
//     ...
//     ...
//
//     3 bottles of beer on the wall
//     3 bottles of beer
//     take one down, pass it around
//     2 bottles of beer on the wall
//
//     2 bottles of beer on the wall
//     2 bottles of beer
//     take one down, pass it around
//     1 bottle of beer on the wall
//
//     1 bottle of beer on the wall
//     1 bottle of beer
//     take one down, pass it around
//     0 bottles of beer on the wall
//
// You will want to watch out for bottle vs bottles.
